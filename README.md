‚Ä¢ Business Problem

Banks manage millions of transactions daily, but managers often lack an easy way to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as loan defaults, revenue streams, profitability, and customer service across branches and product categories.

Key questions include:

What percentage of loans are overdue and how do they impact overall revenue?

Which banking products (loans/deposits) generate the most profit?

How do customer satisfaction levels vary across regions and products?

What are the peak transaction periods and high-performing branches?

‚Ä¢ Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver a single visual tool that:
‚úî Tracks overall banking performance (deposits, loans, revenue).
‚úî Monitors NPAs and their impact on lost income.
‚úî Analyzes profitability across loan and deposit products.
‚úî Highlights customer satisfaction across branches.
‚úî Supports strategic decision-making in lending, deposit mobilization, and service quality.
